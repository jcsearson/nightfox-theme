# Nightfox

"Nightfox" is inspired by the popular Sublime Text 3 theme "Brogrammer".  Brogrammer has a lot of good qualities about it but there were some things I wanted to do in order to help improve the overall feel of this theme.

### Key Upgrades

	1.  General Font:
		a.  Colors were dulled just a tad (or lightened in some cases).
	2.  Main Window:
		a.  Tabs
			1.  The bottom border for tabs of background windows was preserved (darker shade of red).
			2.  A slight width & height increase.
		b.  Background color was changed to a lighter shade of black (almost charcoal) to allow for:
			1.  The vertical lines connecting open/close tags of a given element to be more visually prominant.
			2.  To differentiate the main content from sidebar (as opposed to only using the line counter to distinguish between the two areas).
	3.  Sidebar:
		a.  Hovering over a file will change font coloring to a yellow.
		b.  Toggle switches were also colored (yellow).
		c.  The 2 sidebar headers (open files, folders) were changed to a nice orange color to help differentiate from actual files.
		d.  Hovering over a folder in the sidebar will change the font color to one different from that of individual files (namely a white).
		e.  Font sizes were adjusted for sidebar (they now have a slightly larger default size).
		f.  Left margin reduced for all files.
		g.  Left margin reduced for open files even more.
	4.  Gutter:
		a.  Matching background (with main window) to help preserve max aesthetic appearance of main window.
		b.  The color for all numbers in the vertical line counter were reduced to a dark shade of blue with intent to more easily differentiate between white-colored code & white-colored line numbers.
